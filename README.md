## Shopping Session Simulation

The system can generate realistic shopping sessions including:

- **Session Events**: Browse, search, view product, add to cart, purchase
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Based on persona type and user characteristics
- **Purchase Probability**: Calculated using multiple factors
- **Time Analysis**: Realistic session duration and event timing

## Data Generation

The system generates realistic data using:

- **Faker Library**: For names, emails, addresses
- **Persona Templates**: For consistent user behavior patterns
- **Category Mapping**: For realistic product categorization
- **Price Ranges**: Based on category and persona type
- **Purchase Patterns**: Realistic buying behavior simulation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017/
```

### MongoDB Collections
- `users`: User profiles and preferences
- `products`: Product catalog and metadata
- `purchases`: Transaction history and details

## Development

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

python -m pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Production Considerations
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Configure backup strategies for MongoDB
- Use load balancers for high availability
